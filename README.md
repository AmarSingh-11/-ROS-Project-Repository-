## Software Components

ROS: The Robot Operating System framework for building robotic applications.
Python: Used for developing ROS nodes and implementing robot control algorithms.
Arduino IDE: Used for programming the Arduino board and interfacing with sensors.

## Repository Structure

`src/`: Contains the source code for ROS nodes and packages.
`robot_control/`: ROS package for robot control and navigation.
`sensor_drivers/`: ROS package for interfacing with various sensors.
`obstacle_avoidance/`: ROS package for obstacle detection and avoidance algorithms.
 `launch/`: Contains ROS launch files for running multiple nodes simultaneously.
`config/`: Configuration files for tuning parameters and sensor calibration.
 `docs/`: Documentation and diagrams related to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Install ROS on your system (e.g., ROS Melodic or ROS Noetic).
2. Clone this repository to your workspace: `git clone https://github.com/amarsingh-11/autonomous-mobile-robot.git`
3. Build the ROS packages: `catkin_make`
4. Source the setup script: `source devel/setup.bash`
5. Connect the hardware components (Jetson Nano, Arduino, sensors) to your system.
6. Launch the robot nodes using the provided launch files: `roslaunch launch/robot.launch`

## Usage

Once the robot nodes are running, you can interact with the robot using ROS tools and commands. For example:

 Visualize sensor data using `rviz`.
