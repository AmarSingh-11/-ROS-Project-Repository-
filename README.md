# -ROS-Project-Repository-
Welcome to the ROS Project Repository! This repository contains all the necessary files, scripts, and documentation for our Robotic Operating System (ROS) project.

# Autonomous Mobile Robot Project

This project aims to develop an autonomous mobile robot using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. The robot is equipped with various sensors and components, including a Jetson Nano, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), an Arduino board, ultrasonic sensors, and a LiDAR sensor.

## Hardware Components

Jetson Nano: A powerful embedded computing device for running the ROS nodes and performing computationally intensive tasks.
IMU : An Inertial Measurement Unit for measuring the robot's orientation and motion.
Arduino: A microcontroller board for interfacing with sensors and actuators.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Used for obstacle detection and avoidance.
LiDAR Sensor: A Light Detection and Ranging sensor for mapping the environment and detecting obstacles.

## Software Components

ROS: The Robot Operating System framework for building robotic applications.
Python: Used for developing ROS nodes and implementing robot control algorithms.
Arduino IDE: Used for programming the Arduino board and interfacing with sensors.

## Repository Structure

`src/`: Contains the source code for ROS nodes and packages.
`robot_control/`: ROS package for robot control and navigation.
`sensor_drivers/`: ROS package for interfacing with various sensors.
`obstacle_avoidance/`: ROS package for obstacle detection and avoidance algorithms.
 `launch/`: Contains ROS launch files for running multiple nodes simultaneously.
`config/`: Configuration files for tuning parameters and sensor calibration.
 `docs/`: Documentation and diagrams related to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Install ROS on your system (e.g., ROS Melodic or ROS Noetic).
2. Clone this repository to your workspace: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/autonomous-mobile-robot.git`
3. Build the ROS packages: `catkin_make`
4. Source the setup script: `source devel/setup.bash`
5. Connect the hardware components (Jetson Nano, Arduino, sensors) to your system.
6. Launch the robot nodes using the provided launch files: `roslaunch launch/robot.launch`

## Usage

Once the robot nodes are running, you can interact with the robot using ROS tools and commands. For example:

 Visualize sensor data using `rviz`.
 Send navigation goals using `move_base`.
Monitor robot status and sensor readings using `rostopic`.
